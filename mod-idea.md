# Glitched - the champion mob.

In this mod I'm about to create a new harder mod to make minecraft more challenging, at the same time without hurting so much the core game mechanics (maybe mob farms, but they're technic minecraft so...)

I'm talking about the glitched.

The idea of the glitched is a error-like enemy that can adopt other enemies forms nearby it, and expands its repertory and status thanks to those other vanilla enemies.

The glitched, is a mob that can adopt their forms, their abilities and sum their status to themselves. (like the maxHealth, if a zombie-glitched success to adopting the creeper form of a creeper, then its maxHealth will sum up to 40 [zombie 20 health + creeper 20 health]).

The main abilities of the glitched is:
* form and statuses adoption, it can get stronger with nearby enemies whose form hasn't been adopted.
* regeneration 4, it has the equivalent of regeneration 4.
* sneaky and hard to hit, with each hit, it has 25% probability to teleport nearby its last position.
* nether portal adoption, if it's nearby nether portal block, it has the constant probability to adopt an infernal form like, blaze, ghast or pigman. (They can still spawn in the nether)
* they have a 5% chance to drop a totally random block of minecraft, including command blocks **even if you can't use them in survival, it's a fun way to obtain them**
* the XP drop is multiplied by x3 - x10 depending of how much assimilated forms they have.
* they will **hunt** you to death, using every card they have in their repertory. If you go to the mines, they will explode blocks if they can (in their creeper form, they won't die after exploding). They will *lag* themselves to spam arrows or spam hits.

## dificulty chance of being spawned.
* PEACEFUL: 0% chance of being spawned, for sure.
* EASY: 15% chance of spawn a semi-glitched enemy (a buffed enemy with regeneration 2)
* NORMAL: 50% chance of a semi-glitched and 15% chance of that enemy being a glitched.
* HARD: 100% chande of a semi-glitched and 50% chance of that enemy being a glitched.
